### JoinMarket Origin
It appears that [this bitcointalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg9384411#msg9384411) directly led to the creation of JoinMarket

"Proposal: Pay the coinjoin makers. They will put up offers to do coinjoin along with a fee they ask. The coinjoin transaction would be built up in a similar way to the above example, with the coinjoin maker fee being added to the associated change address and taken away from the coinjoin taker’s change address.""
